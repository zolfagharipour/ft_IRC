change member functions of client and channel to be in the correct place, e.g. join/leave channel in server class isntead of client class
make sure server class holds ptr to clients and channels
what happens with private messages - find out



Then, you have to implement the commands that are specific to channel
operators:
∗ KICK - Eject a client from the channel
∗ INVITE - Invite a client to a channel
∗ TOPIC - Change or view the channel topic
∗ MODE - Change the channel’s mode:
· i: Set/remove Invite-only channel
· t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel
operators
· k: Set/remove the channel key (password)
· o: Give/take channel operator privilege
- l: Set/remove the user limit to channel


#define REQUIRE_OPERATOR(client, channel, action)                   \
    if (!(channel)->hasPermission(client)) {                        \
        std::cerr << (client)->getNickName()                        \
                  << " does not have permission to " << (action)    \
                  << " in channel " << (channel)->getName() << std::endl; \
        return false;                                               \
    }

bool Channel::kickUser(Client *operatorClient, Client *targetClient) {
    REQUIRE_OPERATOR(operatorClient, this, "kick users");

    if (_users.erase(targetClient->getNickName())) {
        _operators.erase(targetClient); // Remove from operators if they are one
        std::cout << targetClient->getNickName() << " has been kicked from channel " << _name << std::endl;
        return true;
    }

    std::cerr << targetClient->getNickName() << " is not in channel " << _name << std::endl;
    return false;
}


/*broadcast for join function*/
    channel topic
    channel __TIMESTAMP__


irssi

any comment starts with a slash
/connect 127.0.0.1 6667 00

>> (we send)
& (we receive from client)
/JOIN helloworld

make sure all places that should be broadcasted to are broadcasted to

operator broadcast?
what if op leaves singular op-ship on free will
changeOperatorPrivilege:: fix if targetUser is not existent numeric reply will receive something nasty
pw and user limit: numeric reply when not enough params

- check that the mode flags are really jsut that e.g. -l2 invalid
- 461 not sent appropriately
- sth with the name passed when mode +o
- invite definitely needs a numeric real nick name too
- add user return false in some cases, 
- taken/granted op rights upon join or leaving channel broadcast?
- invite multiple peple to multiple channels?
