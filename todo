change member functions of client and channel to be in the correct place, e.g. join/leave channel in server class isntead of client class
make sure server class holds ptr to clients and channels

Then, you have to implement the commands that are specific to channel
operators:
∗ KICK - Eject a client from the channel
∗ INVITE - Invite a client to a channel
∗ TOPIC - Change or view the channel topic
∗ MODE - Change the channel’s mode:
· i: Set/remove Invite-only channel
· t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel
operators
· k: Set/remove the channel key (password)
· o: Give/take channel operator privilege
- l: Set/remove the user limit to channel


#define REQUIRE_OPERATOR(client, channel, action)                   \
    if (!(channel)->hasPermission(client)) {                        \
        std::cerr << (client)->getNickName()                        \
                  << " does not have permission to " << (action)    \
                  << " in channel " << (channel)->getName() << std::endl; \
        return false;                                               \
    }

bool Channel::kickUser(Client *operatorClient, Client *targetClient) {
    REQUIRE_OPERATOR(operatorClient, this, "kick users");

    if (_users.erase(targetClient->getNickName())) {
        _operators.erase(targetClient); // Remove from operators if they are one
        std::cout << targetClient->getNickName() << " has been kicked from channel " << _name << std::endl;
        return true;
    }

    std::cerr << targetClient->getNickName() << " is not in channel " << _name << std::endl;
    return false;
}
